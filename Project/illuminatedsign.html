    <p>We offer both non-illuminated and illuminated cabinets. These cabinets can be single sided installed on a wall or on a monument. They can also be double sided, installed on a monument, installed on a pole as a single sign or installed on a pylon with multiple tenant panels. Since our cabinets are custom made, we can create a variety of sizes and shapes. The faces for the cabinets can be made from acrylic or flex material. The acrylic material can be flat faced or raised (pan). The faces can have translucent vinyl,translucent digital graphics, painted faces, or embossed lettering.</p>

    <p>There are many uses for neon and LED. The most common uses are found in channel letters, open signs and used as borders around signs and buildings.  They can be used indoors or outside, and can be mounted as a single stroke or as multiple strokes. Signs By Design has the capability of creating signs using both neon and LED, and can also repair signs using neon or LED. If you have any questions, please call or email our staff</p>

  <div class="tabs-3">
    <p>We offer both non-illuminated and illuminated channel letters. These letters are installed on a wall or on a monument. They are mounted individually to the wall or on a raceway, which is an aluminum box that contains the electrical components for the letters. The raceway can be painted to match the wall. Since our letters are custom made; we can create a variety of sizes using all types of fonts, logos, or custom designs. The letters either have acrylic faces or open faces.   We also have the capability of making your letters one color during the day and white at night.
Channel letters can be illuminated internally, behind the letter(backlit) giving a halo effect, or both. They're illuminated with either neon or LED.</p>
